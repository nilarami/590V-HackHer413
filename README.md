# Data Description:

We want to work with the application data submitted by the applicants of Hack(H)er413, which was conducted here at UMass. We have access to both 2019 as well as 2020 applications, which have been anonymized.  The data is in a tabular form. The number of records is 650 for 2019 and 755 for 2020. We have 19 attributes and 27 attributes for the years 2019 and 2020 respectively. While the 2020 dataset consists of a single table which includes what the applicant RSVPâ€™d and if they actually attended the event, the 2019 dataset stores this information in a separate dataset, which has also been included in the data dictionary. We have an overlap of 22 attributes, which we plan to use for our visualization and analysis.

## Applications:
The main purpose of our visualization and analysis is to see if we can identify some trend which can help us predict who all/ how many people show up to attend the hackathon. From past data, only around 50% of applicants attended the hackathon, and if we could figure out why, we think it will greatly help the organizers in the future. We also think if we could visualize the workshops suggested by the applicants, the organizers would find it easier to decide which ones to conduct or add new ones. We hope to answer the following questions by the end of the project:

-Is there a way we can dynamically visualize states/universities/location where people are traveling from? 
-Is there a connection between attributes and why people who showed up? 
-Can we visualize workshop suggestions?
