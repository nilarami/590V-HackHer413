           This visualization demonstrates the breakdown of accepted and checked-in attendees
           in regards to their use of professional networking platforms. This data is further
           broken down by ethnicity. This icicle chart helps diversity specialists to determine
           if students are being fully supported in their efforts to connect with industry 
           professionals, which is something that a hackathon could help to rectify. Click on the

            This visualization demonstrates the average number of reported skills of applicants 
            next to the average number of reported skills by checked-in attendees. These averages 
            are broken down by ethnicity. This was done to determine if any group self-reported 
            more skills than another group. This also allows Diversity Specialists to see the 
            differences between reported skill level between everyone that applied versus only 
            the participants that showed up to the event. These findings can also help these 
            specialists determine confidence in skills amongst attendees, as one of the goals of 
            Hack(H)er413 is to help beginners learn and feel confidence in their skills.

            This visualization demonstrates the breakdown in ethnicity in accepted, RSVPed, 
            and checked-in participants over the past two years. This visualization is important to the 
            Diversity Specialist because it allows them to see who is being reached by Hack(H)er413 
            and calculate the current retention rate for applicants to attendees. Click on the
