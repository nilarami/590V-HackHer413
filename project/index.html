                Organizers are responsible for raising money, planning and putting on the Hack(H)er413 event every year.
                The team is responsible for raising money from sponsorship companies, marketing, planning mini events
                throughout the hackathon such as workshops & panels, etc. Organizers are looking to make the event
                better every year and want to hear suggestions and use suggestions to do that. Organizers are all female
                and non binary students at the University of Massachusetts. They are currently studying for their
                Bachelors, Masters or PhD’s. They have little to no work experience.

                Sponsors refer to the companies who gave the funds that the Hack(H)er event needed. They are mainly HR
                recruiters and few engineers who are also allowed certain perks based on the amount donated. Some perks
                include having a table at the career fair or holding a workshop demonstrating a company product or
                software. The sponsors are also allowed to interview participants during the hackathon in order to find
                full time employees or summer interns. They also are allowed to add special prizes according to their
                company’s software such as Best Use of the company’s API and more. The sponsors sometimes provide
                goodies as well. But their main aim is to provide the much needed funds to improve the hackathon
                experience and attract attendees.

              Diversity specialists are working professionals in the diversity & inclusion space. They can work in the
              academic or industry setting. Their job is to determine the diversity of various groups and attract
              candidates from various backgrounds. In the case of Hack(H)er413, these specialists want to be able to
              look at the breakdown of age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic background to determine
              where to provide resources to their company or to the organizers in the future. These specialists have a
              Bachelor’s or Master’s degree. These specialists have skills in Excel and in doing research, but they have
              little to no experience with programming. These specialists have worked in the professional setting for 5+
              years.
